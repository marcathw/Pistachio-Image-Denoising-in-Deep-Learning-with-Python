## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

* **Image Denoising**: The process of recovering clean images from noisy inputs.
* **Convolutional Autoencoders**: Neural networks designed for unsupervised feature learning and dimensionality reduction, particularly effective for image data reconstruction.
* **U-Net Architecture**: A specialized convolutional network renowned for its effectiveness in image-to-image translation tasks, leveraged here for its ability to preserve spatial details through **skip connections**.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Fundamental steps to prepare raw image data for effective deep learning model training.
* **Gaussian Noise**: A common type of additive noise used to simulate real-world imperfections in images and train models for noise reduction.
* **Early Stopping**: A powerful regularization technique that prevents model overfitting by halting training when performance on a validation set no longer improves.
* **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: A perception-based metric that provides a more accurate measure of image quality degradation than traditional pixel-difference metrics, focusing on structure, luminance, and contrast.
